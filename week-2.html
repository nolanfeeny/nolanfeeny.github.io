        <div><p>Not much happened in Berlin this week, but this weekend I went to a pretty cool city. I’ll talk about it.</p>
<h1>AMSTERDAM</h1>
<p><img alt="painting" src="./images/am_painting.jpg"></p>
<p>Amsterdam was probably the coolest city I’ve been to in my life. The train ride into the main city was nothing special. Then I walked out of the station and the city just blind sided me. I’ve never seen such a vibrant and alive place before. For the weekend, we stayed at a hotel and spent the days in the city, and the last day at the beach. Some things I noticed - art is a central pillar to the culture of the city. Everywhere you go, buildings are designed to be aesthetically pleasing, there are live musicians, and many free open art galleries.</p>
<p><img alt="garden" src="./images/am_garden.jpg" width="350"></p>
<p>This picture took place between the Van Gogh and the Rijks Museums. We went to the Van Gogh, and I wasn’t expecting much. Just a lot of portraits and starry night. Maybe it was just my low expectations, but I’ve never seen art so good before. There was something about it that really resonated with me. Not the portraits as much, but all of the peasant/rural scenery was almost dreamlike. Very glad I got to see it.</p>
<p><img alt="canal" src="./images/am_canal.jpg"></p>
<p>We also went on a boat ride through the canals, and that was very relaxing. It was a good way to see a completely different perspective of the city architecture. The transition from modern buildings to old Anne Frank resemblant ones was really cool. Amsterdam has so many different facets and options on which to build your lifestyle. The next night I went to a casino for free and won 10 euros. Not a big baller lol. Definitely want to go back some day, especially during the winter.</p></div>
